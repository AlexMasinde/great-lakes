      "The Lake Victoria basin is home to about 40 million people with an average population density of 250 people per square km. The basin population is growing at a rate of 3.5 percent each year, which is among the highest population growth rates in the world. The basin countries (apart from Kenya) are among the poorest in the world, with most of their population living on less than $1.25 per day. Many of the people have no access to clean water or improved sanitation facilities, resulting in high incidences of water-related diseases such as malaria, bilharzia, and cholera. The HIV prevalence of about 24 percent is higher than national averages of ~5-7 percent in other similar countries.",
      "Lake Victoria is the largest African Great Lake by area, the world’s largest tropical lake, and the second largest fresh water body in the world. The lake has gone through major changes in biodiversity, and has been the site of the most development and conservation projects, both failures and successes, of all the African Great Lakes. Lake Victoria was formed about 400,000 years ago, and lies 1,134 m above sea level. It has a surface area of 68,800 km², an average depth of 40 m, a maximum depth of 80 m, a volume of 2,760 km³, and a basin area of 195,000 km², which extends to Rwanda and Burundi. The shoreline is shared by Kenya (6%), Uganda (43%), and Tanzania (51%). The Kagera, Katonga, Sio, Yala, Nyando, Sondu Miriu, and Mara rivers feed the lake and the River Nile carries water out of the lake.",
      "The climate in the lake basin varies from tropical rain forest with rainfall over the lake for much of the year to a semi dry climate with intermittent droughts over some areas, and with temperatures varying between 12-26°C. Most of the lake’s water comes from rainfall (117 km³/year), while almost the same amount of water is lost through evaporation (105 km³/year) and carried out by the Nile (33 km³/year). The natural vegetation of the basin consists of patches of closed evergreen forest along the western and northern shores with open landscapes and swamp wetlands in bays, making a suitable habitat for birds, crocodiles, and hippopotamus. The lake dried out about 17,300 years ago and refilled beginning about 14,700 years ago.",
    ],
    valuesAndInvestmentOpportunities: [
      "Before the 1960s, the lake had had high fish species diversity of more than 500 fish species, mostly local cichlids, carps, and minnows, but these were reduced to less than 300 species after the Nile perch was introduced, which caused a decrease in the clearness of the water.",
      "Lake Victoria supports the largest freshwater fishery in the world which by 2015 was producing one million tons of fish per year. The lake employs about 200,000 people in direct fishing and supports livelihoods of up to four million people. The lake generates over 150 million dollars in export earnings, and provides high quality fish protein to about eight million people in the basin. The lake is an important transport route linking the East African States, is a reservoir for at least four hydropower stations along the Nile, provides water for industrial and domestic use, and regulates local climate. It has the largest number of urban areas in its basin of all the African Great Lakes, and its wetlands receive and treat waste water from both urban and agricultural areas.",
      "Two introduced species, Nile Perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and one native species, Silver Cyprinid (Rastrineobola argentea), currently form the main fishery and present opportunities for value added fish products. Cage culture started on the lake in 2006 and by 2015 was producing about 8,000 tons of fish per year. The lake basin has fertile soils with a climate that supports cash crops such tea and coffee and food crops such as beans, maize and bananas. Most industrial expansion in the African Great Lakes region is in the Lake Victoria basin. Some minerals, such as gold, are mined in the lake basin. Several tourism destinations exist on islands and shorelines and there is potential for sport fishing, boating, and cruising safaris.",
    ],
    ecologicalAndEconomicConcerns: [
      "The original fishery of Lake Victoria consisted of native tilapias but this collapsed during the first half of the 20th century, mainly due to overfishing. Deforestation, land use change, loss of wetland quality, and waste from urban areas, industries and farm lands have polluted the lake and led to loss in water quality, algae blooms, loss of oxygen in the lake and, sometimes, fish kills. These are expected to worsen with the predicted increase in urban areas and other development such as cage fish culture and climate change. Habitat loss and predation by the introduced Nile Perch contributed to the extinction of about 60 percent of the cichlid species. Introduced tilapias, including Nile Tilapia, are taking over the populations of native tilapias. In 1989, the lake was invaded by the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) which lowered water quality. Another invasive weed, Salvenia molesta, is spreading quickly in Lake Kyoga and might invade Lake Victoria. Water levels have been dropping since 1960 due to changes in climate. Climate warming triggered ecosystem changes that led to increased water pollution and changes in lake productivity after the 1970s. Dam construction along the rivers flowing in and out of the lake provides much needed power for the numerous urban areas in the basin, but these dams regulate water flow, which affects water balance, lake biodiversity, and migratory fishes. There have been some conflicts related to resource access between countries sharing the lake.",
    ],
    governance: [
      "National institutions responsible for sustainable use and management of Lake Victoria in countries along the Nile River and within the Lake Victoria basin have been working together with regional institutions such as the East African Community, Lake Victoria Basin Commission and Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization to share information and coordinate sustainable management of the Lake Victoria basin. These efforts have not been very effective due to infrequent and limited funding and ineffective local implementing institutions. Other international organizations and funding agencies such as the World Bank and European Union have carried out projects in the Lake Victoria basin, notably the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) and Implementation of a Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP), but these were all short-term projects. The partner states formed beach management units to promote community participation in managing the resources but these, too, have faced challenges due to poor management. Research institutions in the region have generated some information to guide development and conservation of natural resources, but these have not been very effective due lack of sustainability of the interventions.",
      "There are national policies and regulations to guide development and management of natural resources and the environment in the countries of the Lake Victoria basin. There are also regional practices for sustainable development of the basin and a convention for sustainable development of the fisheries of Lake Victoria. The Lake Victoria Basin countries are, in addition, parties to international policies including conventions on sustainable development and conservation of natural resources and Agenda 21 which requires members to promote sustainable management of natural resources. There have, however, been challenges with enforcing the regulations, partly due to limitations in the national governments carrying out the policies and regulations.",
      "Some management efforts include controlling over-fishing through limiting the type and sizes of gear, fish size, season-length and permitted fishing areas, but these have had limited success due to an open access fisheries policy in the region. There have been efforts to control nutrient enrichment and pollution by planting trees and protecting wetlands, but these have also had limited impact due to continued land use and expansion of urban areas. Water hyacinth infestation was contained, but the plant has remained a permanent part of the ecosystem with the potential for another infestation if water pollution is not controlled. National and regional policies have been put in place to address the impacts of climate change and to guide adaptation and mitigation measures, but these still lack action on the ground.",
      "National governments provide some funds for the management of natural resources, but these are, in most cases, not as much as is needed. International projects, such as LVEMP and IFMP have been short term and many of the practices put into place ended when the project did. There is, therefore, a need to find ongoing funding sources that will allow projects to continue.",
    ],
    requiredInterventions: [
      "There have been efforts to develop and conserve natural resources of the Lake Victoria basin, but these have, in many cases, not been very successful. The main failure seems the short time period of the projects, inefficient and ineffective institutional function, limited funding, and limited awareness of the results of taking no action. These challenges can be reduced through helping institutions work together; strengthening the ability of institutions to do work; sharing of information and best practices; regular funding; matching policies and regulations across agencies; encouraging stakeholders to take action; educating the public about alternative sources of livelihood; and creating a space that will allow organizations to tap into other investment opportunities.",

      "Lake Albert is located in the Western Rift Valley at an altitude of 615 meters above sea level. The lake is shared between Uganda (46%) and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (54%). The lake was formed about 10-12 million years ago. It is about 60 km long and 30 km wide, with a surface area of 5,300 km². It has a shoreline length of 508 km, an average depth of 25 m and maximum depth of 58 m, a water volume of 280 km³ and a basin area of 17,000 km². The primary rivers flowing into the lake are the Semliki River from Lake Edward and the Victoria Nile from Lake Victoria through Lake Kyoga. The Albert Nile flows out of the lake. Most of the lake’s water is carried in by the rivers, which contribute about 45,160 m³/year, although rainfall adds around 5,198 m³/year. Water loss is mainly through river outflow (36,875 m³/year) followed by evaporation (13,093m³/year). Rainfall around the lake ranges between 600 mm in the rift floor and 2000 mm in the mountains. Temperature varies with elevation, and ranges from 15-17°C in high altitude areas (>2,000 m). Areas with altitude from 1,500–2,000 m have mean temperatures ranging from 18–21°C, and in areas with lower altitude, temperature may exceed an average of 21°C.",
      "Population density in some parts of the basin is high with some areas on the Uganda side, such as Hoima district, having a population density of about 149 people/km². The population growth rate in the area is quite high, between 3.25 and 4.37 percent. Many people around the lake, particularly in fishing communities, do not have access to clean drinking water and improved sanitation, while other social services, such as health facilities, are poor. These conditions result in high incidences of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, which is highest among fishers (around 24 percent). The prevalence of other water related diseases, such as malaria, bilharzia, cholera and diarrhea, among communities along the lake and rivers is also high. However, literacy levels around the lake, particularly on the Ugandan side, are up to 70 percent.",
    ],
    valuesAndInvestmentOpportunities: [
      "Fish species diversity is low compared to other AGL lakes with high fish biodiversity such as Lake Malawi. The lake harbors between 40 and 55 species of fish species. The cichlid population in the lake consists of six haplochromines and three tilapia species, all of which are restricted to shallow, sheltered, inshore areas, particularly lagoons. 36 percent of them are found only in Lake Albert. Five percent of non-cichlid fish species are also found only in Lake Albert. The local species Lates macrophthalmus (Albert Lates) is on the IUCN Red List of endangered species. The basin supports diverse biodiversity of flora and fauna with locally specific mammals, birds, amphibians, and plants. Most of the shores of the lake are too steep to allow growth of wetlands except for the delta areas where the Victoria Nile and Semliki River enter the lake. Here the shore is characterized with papyrus swamps and fringes of Vossia.",
      "Lake Albert ranks second in fishery yield after Lake Victoria, with an estimated catch of 172,000 tons per year. The lake supports about 15,420 fishers in Uganda and about 20,000 fishers in DRC. The fishery is dominated by two small pelagic fish species Neobola bredoi (51.5%) and Brycinus nurse (33.6%) with large species Lates spp - Nile perch species (5.7%), Hydrocynus forskalli (4.4%), and Oreochromis niloticus (2.1%). The fishery provides employment, income, and quality protein for the basin communities and water for domestic use. There are prospects for cage fish farming with pilot projects testing cage fish farming on the lake. The area around the lake supports subsistence small holder farming as a livelihood activity. Crops grown include beans, maize and bananas for subsistence and income generation. The climate is favorable for cash crops like tea, coffee and cotton and there are opportunities for sustainable agricultural intensification. Lake Albert gained prominence following discovery of oil in the Albertine region and oil exploration in the basin will likely begin soon. The area around the lake is rich in other minerals such as salt, gold, gypsum and coltan. A hydroelectricity dam is under construction at Murchison Falls. The area is important for tourism due to its proximity to parks like the Murchison Falls National Park, other protected areas, unique biodiversity and beautiful rift valley scenery. Like the other AGL, the lake is important for climate moderation.",

    ecologicalAndEconomicConcerns: [
      "The high population growth rate is putting increasing pressure on land and water resources, leading to increased land use and land use change and habitat degradation through sedimentation, pollution and eutrophication. Demand for fish has increased, leading to increased levels of overfishing. The lake is highly fished due to poverty, limited alternative livelihood activities, its open access nature and limited enforcement of existing fishing laws. As a result, fish diversity has shifted from large fish species to small fish species, and formerly commercially important species such as moonfish and butterfish are no longer captured while the endemic Albert Lates is endangered. Overuse is also causing reduced catches and reduced fish size. The expanding population around the lake and fishing villages due to the oil prospects is increasing demand for land for settlement and agriculture, which leads to cutting trees and draining wetlands, thus causing further loss of habitats and ecosystem health. Trees are also cut for fire wood and charcoal. Poaching in adjacent biodiversity reserves is also increasing as demand for animal protein has increased.",
      "Pollution from domestic waste and agricultural inputs is contributing to the deterioration of aquatic ecosystem heath in the lake. These wastes add to the already problematic nutrient runoff from agricultural areas to make water quality even worse. The lake experiences eutrophication and consequently the lake is rich in phytoplankton and primary production is high. Blue-green algae (Anabaena) cause anoxic conditions, resulting in considerable mortality of the Nile Perch. The lake is now home to an invasive water hyacinth and, although it has been controlled, it remains a permanent component of the ecosystem. Another invasive weed, the Kariba weed (Salvenia molesta) has spread over Lake Kyoga and is expected to invade Lake Albert.",
      "Oil exploration could lead to negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services if oil spills occur.

There is need to regulate activities in the catchments which promote sedimentation and nutrient enrichment to reduce eutrophication and pollution through planting trees, developing earthen retaining walls, terracing to control erosion and constructing sanitary facilities at landing sites.

Its water volume is about 40 km³, with a residence time of 20 years. The primary rivers flowing directly into Lake Edward are Nyamugasani, Ishasaha, Rutshuru, Rwindi, Ntungwe, and Lubilia, but the lake also receives water from Lake George which receives water from river from the Ruwenzori Mountains. Most of the water flow out of the lake is via the Semliki River to Lake Albert over a series of waterfalls that have prevented in fish migrations between the two water bodies.

The fishery directly employs about 1000 fishers in DRC and 1100 in Uganda. The lake and its surroundings support diverse habitats with high plant and animal biodiversity. Many of the mammals, birds, amphibians and plants are unique to this lake basin. The lake is surrounded by two National parks (Virunga and Queen Elizabeth) within the Albertine conservation area.

Increasing demand for land for settlement and agriculture is accompanied by unsustainable tree cutting and wetland draining, leading to habitat loss and degradation. All of this presents many challenges to the diverse plants and animals in the region. Oil exploration in the Albertine region poses a threat of pollution to the lake, as has been the case with copper mining in Kasese near Lake George. Climate change is worsening the impact of human population growth, conflicts and poverty.

The towns of Goma in DRC and Gisenyi in Rwanda are near the lake and the tourist hotels have been built on the shore. Future urbanization should be carefully planned with an intent to reduce impacts on the lake. The combined effect of agricultural intensification and urbanization in the densely populated western province of Rwanda is a potential source of pollution and eutrophication. Increase in temperature, decrease in wind speed, shifts in relative humidity and changes in lake levels over the past four decades are thought to have contributed to a decline in catches of the Lake Tanganyika sardine.

It is the ninth largest freshwater lake on Earth by surface area at 29,500 km², and the third deepest with a maximum depth of 700 m and average depth of 264 m. Rainfall into the lake averages 39 km³/year and the lake also gains water from the Ruhuhu, Rukuru (North and South), Songwe, Dwangwa, Lilongwe, Cobue, and Bua Rivers (29 km³/year). The lake loses water through evaporation (57 km³/year) and the Shire river (12 km³/year).",

Temperature ranges between 22°C and 27°C, with south easterly winds between May and September and northerly winds between November and March. A small increase in rainfall, if it is not matched by evaporation, results in flooding, while the reverse can result in the basin drying out and not delivering water to the river. The lake’s geologic history shows a major decline in lake levels at the beginning of 15th century and a possible recovery toward 1700, but persistent dry climate and low lake levels up to the mid-19th century.

The rate of HIV occurrence in the fishing district of Mangochi, Malawi, is 21 percent compared to the national average of 12 percent. In addition, the frequency of schistosomiasis and typhoid fever are high due to limited access to clean water.

    ecologicalAndEconomicConcerns: [
      "Like other African Great Lakes, Lake Malawi/Nyassa/Niassa, is currently threatened by climate change, overuse of resources, invasive species, habitat loss, and pollution. Use of destructive fishing gear and methods contributed to the decline in catches of the highly valued ‘Chambo’ fishes, and, together with habitat degradation, especially on the northern shores and parts of the southern Mozambique section of the lake, contributed to the collapse of two fish species found only in this lake, Tana Labeo (Labeo mesops) and Lake Salmon (Opsaridium microlepis).  Both overuse and habitat degradation are due to the high population growth rate of 2.8 percent per year. The lake is also under threat from invasive fishes and weeds. In 2010, two highly invasive fish species, Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and Blue Spotted Tilapia (O. leucostictus) were first recorded in the Lake Malawi/Nyasa/Niassa basin. These fish pose a huge threat to the lake’s cichlid diversity since Nile Tilapia is known to replace native tilapias in most lakes in which it has been introduced.  Aquatic weeds, especially water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), Salvinia molesta, and Pistia stratiotes, are, as in the case of Lake Victoria, of major concern to biodiversity.  E. crassipes, was first introduced in the 1960s, but has not yet become abundant due to limited nutrients.  However, the current trend of deforestation on steep slopes, agriculture in the form of sugar plantations, industry—Dwangwa Mill, the sugar industry, and ethanol—as well as Uranium mining on the western shore of the lake and planned oil extraction, may change the water quality of the lake and encourage the growth of water hyacinth.",

      "Lake Tanganyika was formed about 9-12 million years ago in the western arm of the East African rift valley. It is located within Burundi (8%), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (45%), Tanzania (41%), and Zambia (6%). It has a basin area of 223,000 km² and extends for 676 km in a north-south direction and averages 50 km in width. It the deepest lake in Africa with a maximum depth of 1,470 m and average depth of 580 m, the second deepest lake in the world, and the largest among the rift lakes with a surface area of 32,600 km² and a shoreline of 1,828 km. The lake holds an estimated 18,980 km³ of water, which is as much as the five North American Great Lakes combined. It is the largest lake in Africa and second largest in the world by volume.",
      "Despite its large volume, the lake is sensitive to climatic conditions. The climate of the basin is characterized by two seasons; a wet season between October and April, and a dry season between May and September. Rainfall is estimated at 29 km³/year and evaporation at 50 km³/year, therefore, any major drop in annual rainfall and consistent increase in temperature can affect the lake’s water level. The lake may, however, not suffer rapid change in depth because of its large basin and three major rivers adding water to the lake: Rusizi, Malagarasi, and Kalambo (contributing 14 km³/year), as well as the Lukuga River carrying 2.7 km³ of water per year out of the lake.",
      "The population density of the Lake Tanganyika basin varies between 13-250 persons/km². The full drainage basin has a population of greater than 10 million people which is growing at a rate of 2.0-3.2 percent per year. This is putting much pressure on the resources and is worsened by the small economies of the countries that border the lake, which are among the poorest nations in the world with an average per capita GNP of US $110-320. The lake basin has the poorest and least developed regions of the four riparian countries with low literacy levels, especially in parts of Burundi and DRC where a large portion of the population live on less than US $1 per day. This makes adaptation to environmental stresses such as climate change a major problem. Despite these barriers, the region has registered tremendous progress in fighting HIV/AIDS, whose prevalence is currently 6.4 percent, likely because of donor funding which should be continued.",
    ],
    valuesAndInvestmentOpportunities: [
      "Lake Tanganyika is one of the richest freshwater ecosystems in the world with about 2000 species of fish, plants, crustaceans, and birds. About 500 of the species are not found anywhere else on Earth, and 50 percent of those species are cichlid fishes. The lake is, therefore, a unique habitat for biodiversity conservation and evolutionary studies.",
      "Three fish species, Lake Tanganyika Sardine (Limnothrissa miodon), Sleek Lates (Lates stappersii), and Lake Tanganyika Sprat (Stolothrissa tanganicae), constitute the major commercial fisheries. Both commercial and artisanal fisheries yield 165,000-200,000 tons of fish per year, employ about 100,000 people in fisheries related activities, and provide 25-40 percent of the protein needs to one million people living around the lake. The lake is internationally famous in the ornamental fish trade as a source of prized aquarium stock.",
      "Investment opportunities in the lake basin, including cage fish farming; farming on slopes or strips of land between the rift escarpment and the lake; oil and gas development, especially in the southern shores, Ruzizi River basin border of Burundi and DRC and along the north-eastern shore of the lake; and tourism in four national parks—Ruisizi River Nature Reserve in Burundi, Gombe River and Mahale Mountains National Parks in Tanzania, and Nsumbu National Park in Zambia.",
    ],
    ecologicalAndEconomicConcerns: [
      "The ecosystem services of Lake Tanganyika and its catchment are threatened by the high population growth, overuse of resources, invasive species, habitat degradation, pollution and climate change. The rapidly growing population contributes to a loss of water quality in the lake. This population is also exerting intense fishing pressure, especially in the northern (Burundi) and southern (Zambia) parts of the lake, where the fishable stock of high-valued Sleek Lates has significantly declined.  There are, in addition, about 30 invasive weeds and plants, the major ones being the five floating weeds: Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), Pistia (Pistia stratiotes), Azolla sp., Lemna sp., and Salvinia molesta. Although these weeds have, as in the case of Lake Malawi, not spread over much of the lake, discharge of urban and industrial waste from urban areas along the shore and agricultural inputs from the steep slopes may change the water quality, especially within shallow areas of the lake, and cause the weeds to increase. For instance, all of the northern drainage area and more than half of the central area have been cleared of their natural vegetation, which is likely to cause more erosion and sedimentation, and a decline in species richness. These threats are made worse by climate variability and change where warming of the lake contributes to a reduction in nutrient recycling in upper layers of the lake, and is accompanied by a loss in primary production and catches of pelagic fish species.",
    ],
    governance: [
      "The lake has a regional organization, the Lake Tanganyika Authority (LTA) to coordinate development and management efforts on the lake. The LTA ratified a Framework Fisheries Management Plan (FFMP) to jointly monitor and manage the shared resources of the lake, and has instituted an Invasive Alien Species (IAS) program to monitor and manage invasive species in the lake and its basin. The countries along the lake have institutions that conduct research and implement management measures in development and conservation of natural resources. The countries also have policies and regulations that guide development and conservation of fisheries and other natural resources and are parties to international treaties e.g. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), which bind them to establish mechanisms for managing the threats to biological diversity. Non-governmental organizations, such as Tanganyika Catchment Reforestation (TACARE), promote reforestation and conservation education to local populations. A waste water treatment plant has also been installed in Bujumbura to treat 40 percent of urban and industrial water. There are efforts to diversify livelihoods to help increase household income and food security with the hopes that people will be more able to cope with the impacts of climate change.",
      "The above efforts have, as for the other lakes, been constrained by limited funding. Most of the projects aimed at ecosystem restoration have been supported by development partners such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Global Environmental Facility (GEF), National Science Foundation (NSF), and United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), which are all short term and cannot be continued after the project funding ends.",

    requiredInterventions: [
      "The required interventions on Lake Tanganyika are similar to those on Lake Victoria as both lakes have national and regional institutions. These include: networking with other regional institutions; improvement of regional coordination of institutions in development and conservation of the lake and its basin; development and harmonization of enabling policies for adaptive management; devising internal funding mechanisms for sustainable management of the lake and its basin; scaling up alternative livelihood programs to improve adaptive capacity and reduce the dependence on vulnerable fisheries resources; sharing information and increasing awareness; and promoting community participation in implementation of best practices to manage the resources.",

    biophysicalCharacteristics: [
      "Lake Turkana lies in the Eastern Rift Valley in northern Kenya with its far northern end extending to Ethiopia. The lake was formed about 4.3 million years. The lake extends for 290 km in a north-south direction and has an average width of 32 km. Unlike other rift valley AGLs, such as Malawi, Tanganyika, and Kivu, Lake Turkana is shallow, with a mean depth of 30 m and a maximum depth of 109 m. It is the world's largest permanent desert and alkaline lake with a surface area of 6,405 km² and a shoreline of 820 km. The lake’s water comes from river inflows, and there is no river outflow, so lake water is lost only through evaporation. Three rivers, including Omo, Turkwel, and Kerio flow into the lake, but only the Omo River is perennial, contributing 90 percent of the inflow or about 19 billion m³ of water each year. The area around the lake is hot and arid, with extended periods of intense daytime winds and low annual rainfall (< 250 mm), usually in March-May. As a result, almost the same amount of water is lost through evaporation. The average temperature in the region is between 28-30 oC. Owing to this climate, the vegetation around the lake is mainly shrub land and desert. Some grassland appears only during the wet period and disappears during drier times. In addition to climate variability and change, the lake is threatened by damming and irrigation in the Omo valley.",
      "The Lake Turkana basin is sparsely populated, with a population density of about six persons/km². This small population is highly vulnerable to different external pressures. Only 28 percent of households in the Turkana District have access to potable water, and the average distance to the nearest potable water point is 10 km. Data from the 2009 Turkana Central District Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation puts the HIV prevalence rate at 7 percent, with tuberculosis (TB) being one of the leading causes of death among people living with HIV/AIDS. These conditions are compounded by low literacy levels and extremely high poverty levels. People in the basin are among the poorest in Kenya, with 94 percent living below the poverty line and up to 50 percent of the population in some areas relying on food aid.",
    ],
    valuesAndInvestmentOpportunities: [
      "Unlike other large AGLs, such as Tanganyika, Victoria, and Malawi, with high fish species diversity, Lake Turkana has about 50 fish species of which only 11 are local only to the lake. However, the lake supports over 350 native and migratory bird species and the world’s largest remaining population of the Nile crocodile. There are three national parks (Sibiloi, Central and Southern Islands) which provide the potential for tourism. The lake is a major recreation area, especially for youth, for swimming, sport fishing, and other marine sports.",
      "The Lake Turkana fishery is comprised of the Nile perch, Nile tilapia, and Labeo horie. The fishery directly employs about 3000 fishers and yields about 4000 tons of fish per year, providing high quality animal protein to the population around the lake. Fishing on the lake is still a subsistence activity and does not contribute much to the national economy. Commercial fisheries in the region provide an investment opportunity as fishery resources in the lake seem to be underutilized. The fishery, together with agro-pastoralism, supports livelihoods of about 300,000 Kenyans, from six main tribal groups. The lake’s major water source, the Omo River, supports hydro-electric power generation and rice irrigation in the Omo valley. The area bordering the lake is, for the most part, unsuitable for growing crops which leads to a high dependence on cattle.",
    ],
    ecologicalAndEconomicConcerns: [
      "The ecosystem services of Lake Turkana are threatened by habitat degradation—especially by damming of the Omo River and irrigation in the Omo Valley, biodiversity loss, pollution, tribal conflicts and climate change. Heavy grazing along the lower Omo valley, especially along watering routes and settlement close to the rivers contributes to pollution by human and livestock waste. These concerns could potentially be heightened by development of oil resources, especially along the western shores of the lake. In addition, about 150,000-200,000 hectares of woodland in southern Ethiopia are cleared annually for wood fuel, exposing soils to strong winds which causes siltation of the lake.",
      "Fluctuations in the ecosystem associated with climate change and human activities within the basin have caused biodiversity loss, especially endangering tiger fish and minnows within the lake. The water balance and fisheries of the lake are highly sensitive to rainfall and drought, and this is expected to worsen with intensification of climate change. This is exacerbated by the use of water for irrigation in the Omo river valley. Construction of a hydropower dam and the large irrigation scheme in the Omo valley are expected to cause a drop in lake level by 20 m since 90 percent of its water comes from the Omo River. The area also has tribal conflicts branded by banditry and livestock rustling. Unlike other AGLs, there is no evidence of decreased viability of fish stocks through use of destructive fishing practices and the lake is believed to be under-utilized. An introduced weed Prosopis juliflora, which toxic to animals and highly invasive, creates dense and impenetrable thickets, making the shores inaccessible, is a threat to the lake.",
    ],
    governance: [
      "Lake Turkana resources are directly managed by government ministries/departments/agencies. Like Lake Malawi, there is no regional institution around Lake Turkana to coordinate management interventions across the basin. This puts the burden of coordination and cooperation on stakeholders working on conservation and development in the basin, especially regarding the use of water in the Omo valley, and mechanisms should be put in place to create a regional management institution. Riparian countries have national policies and regulations for the development and management of resources within the basin. The main management challenge is related to management of inflows from the Omo River. Other management issues relate to the management of fisheries and control of invasive weeds. The activities within the lake basin are funded by national governments as well as internationally funded projects, all of which are short-term and not sustainable.",
